This code is JavaScript that interacts with a webpage. It uses the Document Object Model (DOM) to access and manipulate HTML elements on the page.

The first four lines use the getElementById and querySelector methods to select specific elements on the page with the specified id or class name.

The following four lines add event listeners to the elements selected. Event listeners are used to detect when an event (such as a button click) occurs on a specific element.

The first event listener is added to the increment button, and it increases the value displayed on the page by the value entered in the changeBy input field.

The second event listener is added to the decrement button, and it decreases the value displayed on the page by the value entered in the changeBy input field.

The third event listener is added to the changeBy input field, and it checks the value entered in the field. If the value is not a number, it sets it to 1. If the value is less than 0, it sets it to 1. If the value is greater than 10, it sets it to 10.

The fourth event listener is added to the reset button, it sets the value displayed on the page back to 0 when the button is clicked.
